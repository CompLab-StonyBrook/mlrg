Hello MathLing enthusiasts! This week (December 7) Jon will be workshopping on an idea, "Tensor Product Representations of Finite Relational Models."

This will be our last meeting of the semester, so I'd like to take this moment to thank everyone for volunteering, participating, and attending meetings throughout the term. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. :)

Hope to see you at the conclusion of MLRG Fall 2018!
