Title: Meeting Time Poll for Fall 2018
Author: Thomas Graf
Date: 2018-08-21

Welcome back everyone!

With the start of a new semester, we have to once again agree on a meeting time.
As usual, we will meet for one hour each Friday at some time around noon.
Please indicate your scheduling constraints at the [when2meet poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?7018028-BSZj7).
