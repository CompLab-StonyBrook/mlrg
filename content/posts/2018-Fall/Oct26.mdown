Hi all, this week's meeting (October 26) is cancelled since a large chunk of thegroup will not be around to attend. We also need a volunteer to present the next chapter of _Neural Network Methods_ for next week's meeting, so if you are interested please get in touch with me at <ayla.karakas@stonybrook.edu>! =)
