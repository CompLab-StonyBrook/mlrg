Hi folks! At tomorrow's meeting (October 19), Thomas will talk about the subregular complexity of segmental phonology.  He will present IO-TSL as a new extension of TSL and explain how this class captures Sanskrit n-retroflexion (nati), perhaps the most complex known process in segmental phonology.

This is based on joint work with Connor Mayer (UCLA), which will be presented at this year's SIGMORPHON.
