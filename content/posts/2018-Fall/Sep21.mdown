Author: Ayla Karakas

This Friday (September 21), Jon will be presenting chapter 3 of Yoav Goldberg's _Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing_. No reading necessary, but it may be helpful to take a look and/or review the handouts provided by AlÃ«na when she presented the introduction and chapter 2 a couple weeks ago. Both the textbook and handouts can be found in the Google drive. Hope to see you at the meeting!
