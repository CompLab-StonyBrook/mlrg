Hi all!

This week Hwichan will tell us about gapping and CGs. 
We'll meet in the Comp Ling lab at the usual time.

Also of interest for some of you, the Linguistic Dept. Colloquium series will host Sam Bowman,
a new computational linguist at NYU. Follow [the link](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/events/colloquium/2017/04/07/sam.bowman) for more info.
