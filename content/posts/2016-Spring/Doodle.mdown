As usual, we need to agree on a meeting time.
To the best of my knowledge, there will be no classes scheduled for Friday this semester, so we should have a wider range of options than last time around.
Anyways, you know the procedure: go to the [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/n45arsat6rc6hcmn) and fill in the form.
