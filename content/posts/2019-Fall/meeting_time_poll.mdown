Date: 2019-08-22

Welcome back everyone!

With the start of a new semester, we have to once again agree on a meeting time.
As usual, we will meet for one hour each Friday at some time around noon.
Please indicate your scheduling constraints at the [when2meet poll](http://mlrg.thomasgraf.net/survey).

You do not need to create an account, just login with your name and mark all slots in green that work for you.
