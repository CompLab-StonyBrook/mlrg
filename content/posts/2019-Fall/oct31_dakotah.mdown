Title: Dakotah on a TSL learner
Author: Dakotah Lambert
Date: 2019-10-31

Tomorrow Dakotah will be discussing a way to modify a typical SP learner to account for TSL stringsets.
Any feedback would be appreciated, on topics from the algorithm itself to the types of things that should be discussed when presenting a Gold-style learner.
Hope to see you all there!
