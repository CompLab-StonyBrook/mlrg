Title: No Meeting on Oct 11

Date: 2019-10-11

We're not meeting this week because of [AMP](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/amp2019/). There's plenty of computational talks on the AMP program, and I encourage you all to attend those instead.

Next week, Oct 18, Aniello will give a practice talk in the reading group.
