Hello all, hope you had a nice Thanksgiving break!
This Friday, Alëna will be practicing for the SCiL tutorial session.
We hope that as the semester winds to a close, you can make the time to stop by for it.
To leave time for discussion and feedback after the tutorial, we will be starting at 11:30am instead of noon that day.
Hope to see you all there!
