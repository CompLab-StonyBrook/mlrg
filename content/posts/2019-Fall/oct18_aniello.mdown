Title: Aniello on MG Processing
Author: Thomas Graf
Date: 2019-10-18

Today Aniello will be talking about his research on modelling sentence processing with a top-down parser for Minimalist grammars.
This is a practice talk, so we might go longer than usual.
Hope to see you all there, and I'm sure Aniello is looking forward to your feedback.
