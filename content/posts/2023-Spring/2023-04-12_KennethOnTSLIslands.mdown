I will talk about a project me and Thomas contributed to using a probabilistic version of TSL* for trees, combining Thomas's tree TSL with Connor Mayer's string pTSL. We fit a model to experimental data on island effects from Sprouse et al 2016.



*TSL: Tier-based Strictly Local; pTSL: probabilistic TSL
