We will not be meeting this Friday, because of a Blitztalk that takes place 1:00-2:00 pm on the same day. The Blitztalk is part of the virtual open house for the next cohort of PhD students, which, as Thomas emphasizes, "<ins><cite>is perhaps the most important event of the day, and a strong turnout means a lot for recruitment.</cite></ins>" So if you do have time, please consider going to the Blitztalk!
