Author: Ayla Karakas
Date: 2019-02-14

Hi all! Apologies for the later than usual announcement. Tomorrow (Feb. 15) Nazila will be presenting about island complexity.
Afterwards, we'll be hanging out in the seminar room for an InFormal Friday (IFF) gathering, so come by if you'd like to unwind -- bring snacks/drinks if you like! :)
Hope to see you there!
