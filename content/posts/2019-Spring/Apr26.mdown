Hi all! At tomorrow's meeting (4/26) Alëna and I will be presenting our methodology and results for tracking morphological changes across Shakespeare's early and later works, as the spellings in these are texts are inconsistent by virtue of being from a time before English orthography became standardized. Hope to see you there!
