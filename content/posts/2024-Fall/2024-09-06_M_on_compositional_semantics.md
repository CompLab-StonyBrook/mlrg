This week M will be presenting original research on compositional semantics.

Although compositional semanticists tend to have a lot to say about the logical forms of lexical items and sentences, they tend to have a lot less to say about what truly makes their theory run: the nature of semantic rules.

The goal here is to investigate such rules, using the axiom "no semantic ambiguity" and the form of the interpretation relation's domain to reveal several interesting properties.
