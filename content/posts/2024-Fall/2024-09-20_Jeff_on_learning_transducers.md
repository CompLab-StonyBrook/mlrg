This week [Kenneth](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net) will be presenting his work on agreement on multiple tiers. 

Often, agreement targets the closest DP to some functional head which bears the right features. 
But in some languages there are other hierarchies, such person/animacy, which outrank structural closeness. 
Kenneth shows how such hierarchies can be implemented with a MTSL grammar over command strings.
