Date: 2022-10-3

This Friday (Oct 7), [Jordan](https://jkodner05.github.io/) will be discussing David Marr's levels of analysis in cognitive science, and where and how mathematical linguistics fits into our understanding of linguistic cognition and what that tells us about theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics. Chapters from [Marr (1982)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEJuyAdPrNcSPbNPesJOD8o3RmRob-G-/view?usp=sharing) and [Lignos (2013)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KRYnzUgUqbxGd1d7fL_5ITTCDhNB4tN3/view?usp=sharing) will also be discussed.
