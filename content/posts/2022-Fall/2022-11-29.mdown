Jeff will give a presentation this Friday (Dec 2) about definite and reverse definite languages and generalizations thereof. This will be our last MLRG meeting for this semester. Hope to see you all there!

**Note**: The meeting will again take place at the seminar room (SBS S-207), instead of the compling lab.
