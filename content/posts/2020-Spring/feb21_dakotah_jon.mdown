Title: Dakotah and Jon on GFSAs
Author: Dakotah Lambert
Date: 2020-02-20

Tomorrow Dakotah and Jon will be talking about their ongoing work involving generalized finite state automata.
They'll be discussing a class of string-to-string transducers that corresponds to a certain idea of locality in origin-graph semantics.
As this is a work in progress, they'd appreciate any feedback you might have!
