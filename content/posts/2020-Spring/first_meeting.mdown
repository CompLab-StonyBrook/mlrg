Scheduling this year's MLRG has turned out to be a lot trickier than usual.
The time that seems to work for most people is

- Friday, 2pm to 3pm.

We will have our first organizational meeting tomorrow at this time.
Based on who shows up, and pending further discussion, the time slot for the rest of the semester might still change.
