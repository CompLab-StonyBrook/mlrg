Title: Matthew on Control languages (03/28)
Author: Anton Hampe

This week Matthew Hayden will be giving us an introduction to control grammars. 
Intuitively, a control grammar is a grammar whose possible paths of derivation are constrained by some set of strings, called the control language.
Matthew will go over the basics of control grammars, discuss their expressibility, and compare them with other generative formalisms that we see more commonly in linguistics. 
He'll show how control grammars can bridge across all regions of the Chomsky hierarchy. He will present research on their application for finite-state transduction, weak equivalence to MGs and a possible connection to learning.
