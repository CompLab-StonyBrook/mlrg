Title: Kenneth on mixed-relation TSL (03/07)

For the first session, Kenneth will be talking about mixed-relation TSL.

String TSL involves relativizing the precedence relation to a tier of salient elements. 
For trees, there are more choices: we can relativize dominance and precedence (Graf 2022) as well as derived relations such as d-command (Graf and Shafiei 2019). 
Going even further, we can construct constraints which make simultaneous reference to multiple relations, but which are otherwise no more complex than the familiar SL/SP/TSL (Rogers and Lambert 2019). 
Today, I want to explore some potentially useful application of these techniques: 

1) combine relativized dominance and command to model case dependencies, 

and 2) define new command relations that take movement into account, allowing for a proper TSL treatment of NPI-licensing and Binding Principle A.
