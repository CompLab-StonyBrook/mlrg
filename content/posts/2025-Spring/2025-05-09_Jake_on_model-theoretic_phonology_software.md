Title: Jake on model-theoretic phonology software (05/09)

Model theoretic logical transductions are a very exciting, relatively recent development in phonology, with a lot of insights still yet to be unearthed. Much work that has been done has been focused either on general expressive capacity given representational choices, or specific transductions as analysis of specific language phenomena. In this session, I would like to present a different angle on these transductions that I've developed in working on a software implementation, more general than any one analysis, but not so all-encompassing as general expressivity: the nature of Transductive Recipes as an aid to analysis. I believe the key to further development of theoretical insight and wider adoption of the formalism is to get a good grasp of the strategies that its users find useful, so I will be presenting some of these and soliciting feedback and discussion.
