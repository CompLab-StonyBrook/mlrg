As previously announced by Vinny, we'll have our first meeting tomorrow, September 17, at 2:15pm in the Department Seminar Room.
Keep in mind that this semester we're running MLRG as the Mathematical Linguistics **Recreation** Group, so bring food and drinks and be ready for a relaxed time of witty banter.
