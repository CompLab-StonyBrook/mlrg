Author: Jon Rawski
Date: 2017-09-13

Hi all!

This Friday, Aniello is going to talk about geometrical approaches to morphological paradigms,
based on a recent paper by Goldsmith.
As usual, you don't need to read the paper, but if you are curious you can find it in the Math Reading Group's Google Drive.

See you all on Friday!
