This is the website for the Mathematical Linguistics Reading Group in the [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.stonybrook.edu) at [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu).

The reading group provides a venue for

- paper discussions,
- practice talks,
- invited talks,
- presentations of ongoing research,
- and much more.

Pretty much anything goes, as long as it has some formal/mathematical component to it.
The group is very interdisciplinary in nature and we welcome guests from other departments.
