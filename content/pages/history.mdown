While meetings are open to whatever somebody in the group wants to talk about, we usually pick a main topic for each semester.
So far, the following topics have been covered:

Semester    | Topic
----------- | ------------
S16         | Game theory
F15         | Dynamic semantics
S15         | Generalized quantifiers
F14         | Lattices in linguistics
S14         | Modal logic
