Hi all!

Sorry for the late announcement.
We will not be meeting tomorrow, since some of us are going to give a short intro to Linguistics to some logics students.
We also have a couple of free slots available before the end of the semester. 
If you have something you want to present, send me and email.

Have a great week end!
