Hi all!

In our next meeting (Friday, Feb 24), we will talk about Semantics in Categorial Grammars,
and in particular we'll see how CCGs can handle quantifiers scope ambiguities.

In case you are particularly interested in the topic, you can check out  *Surface-Compositional Scope-Alternation Without Existential Quantifiers*
, a 2010 paper by Mark Steedman now uploaded in our shared Google Drive.
