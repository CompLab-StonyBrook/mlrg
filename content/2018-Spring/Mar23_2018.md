Hi all!

This Friday, March 9th, James Rogers from earlham college is visiting our dept. We will have a free-form discussion and brainstorm of various advances in Tier-Based Strictly Local Languages. No reading is required, though familiarity with formal languages and the Subregular Hierarchy will be helpful. Hope to see you all there!
