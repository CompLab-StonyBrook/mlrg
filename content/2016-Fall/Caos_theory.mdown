Hi all!

This week (usual time, usual place) Gary will introduce us to the complexities of Chaos Theory -
it'll be a lot of fun!

In the Google Drive Folder, you can now find a simple and playful introduction about Gary's 
research on "Chaos, Fractals and the Dynamical Semantics of Paradox."  
Gary also sent me a paper he contributed to the Alonzo Church memorial volume. Check it out!


See you on Friday!
