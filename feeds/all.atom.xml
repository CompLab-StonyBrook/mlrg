&lt;p&gt;This has allowed linguists not only to better understand the cognitive nature of phonological generalizations but also to design learning algorithms for them, something that is provably intractable if the regular space is not restricted in some way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently there has been an increased focus on achieving similar goals for phonological processes. 
Ideally, some of the results linguists have uncovered while studying phonotactics would be transferable into this new domain, and indeed this has been possible in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous transductions allow us to lift certain classes of languages to classes of string-to-string functions in a way that has not been explored from a linguistic perspective yet. 
We will talk about what it means for a transduction to be continuous, how this notion relates to numerical continuous functions and more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2024-Fall"></category></entry><entry><title>M on compositional semantics (09/06)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2024-fall/m-on-compositional-semantics-0906.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T12:33:06-04:00</updated><author><name>Anton Hampe</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2024-09-02:/mlrg/news/2024-fall/m-on-compositional-semantics-0906.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week M will be presenting original research on compositional semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although compositional semanticists tend to have a lot to say about the logical forms of lexical items and sentences, they tend to have a lot less to say about what truly makes their theory run: the nature of semantic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to investigate such rules, using the axiom "no semantic ambiguity" and the form of the interpretation relation's domain to reveal several interesting properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2024-Fall"></category></entry><entry><title>Han on tone (5/3)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2024-spring/han-on-tone-53.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T22:02:53-04:00</updated><author><name>Kenneth Hanson</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2024-05-01:/mlrg/news/2024-spring/han-on-tone-53.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Han will present her work on tone patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2024-Spring"></category></entry><entry><title>Alina on multiple wh-movement (4/26)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2024-spring/alina-on-multiple-wh-movement-426.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T22:02:53-04:00</updated><author><name>Kenneth Hanson</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2024-04-26:/mlrg/news/2024-spring/alina-on-multiple-wh-movement-426.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Alina will present her work on multiple wh-movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2024-Spring"></category></entry><entry><title>Scott on Underspecification (4/19)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2024-spring/scott-on-underspecification-419.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T22:02:53-04:00</updated><author><name>Kenneth Hanson</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2024-04-15:/mlrg/news/2024-spring/scott-on-underspecification-419.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Scott will be presenting on the topic of underspecification, presumably of the phonological variety.
