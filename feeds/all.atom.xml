Topics include fixed point logics, subregular formal languages, transductions with logic and automata, algorithmic learning, and phonological phenomena (harmony, stress, optionality, and more). It is more of an informal forum than organized talks, and open to everyone! A schedule can be found &lt;a href="http://jeffreyheinz.net/events/WCP3program.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
