As humans, stylometric choices (i.e. the linguistic choice we make when writing) are innate, meaning we subconsciously make them without much thought. How can we build a system to automatically detect these stylistic choices in author’s documents, while also ignoring the content embedded within? Given a document, can we use these detected styles to automatically choose the correct author from a space of known authors? Additionally, we are concerned with &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; an author is chosen over the others, so explainability is an important factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present my work on grammatical feature extraction and how we can generate grammatical “footprint” vectors. These vectors encapsulate author’s writing styles which can further be used for authorship identification, and later down the line, authorship obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2023-Spring"></category></entry><entry><title>Thomas on subregular succinctness arguments at 1:30 pm (Apr 21)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2023-spring/thomas-on-subregular-succinctness-arguments-at-130-pm-apr-21.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-06T12:34:05-04:00</updated><author><name>Zhengxiang (Jack) Wang</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2023-04-18:/mlrg/news/2023-spring/thomas-on-subregular-succinctness-arguments-at-130-pm-apr-21.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thomas will present a concrete case in syntax where subregular complexity considerations favor one of two competing analyses even though both have the same complexity.

Concretely, both the Ban on Improper Movement and Stefan Keine's probe horizons are TSL over dependency trees, but they differ in succinctness. With probe horizons, the number of tiers grows linearly with the number of features, whereas it grows quadratically in grammars with the Ban on Improper Movement. TSL succinctness thus favors probe horizons over the Ban on Improper Movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2023-Spring"></category></entry><entry><title>Kenneth on island effects via pTSL for trees at 1:30 pm (Apr 14)</title><link href="https://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/news/2023-spring/kenneth-on-island-effects-via-ptsl-for-trees-at-130-pm-apr-14.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-06T12:34:05-04:00</updated><author><name>Zhengxiang (Jack) Wang</name></author><id>tag:complab-stonybrook.github.io,2023-04-12:/mlrg/news/2023-spring/kenneth-on-island-effects-via-ptsl-for-trees-at-130-pm-apr-14.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I will talk about a project me and Thomas contributed to using a probabilistic version of TSL* for trees, combining Thomas's tree TSL with Connor Mayer's string pTSL.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puzzle&lt;/strong&gt;: Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and Tweedledoo are identical triplets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each either tells the truth all day long or tells lies all day long.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedledum lies only on Mondays and Tuesdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedledee lies only on Wednesdays and Thursdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedledoo lies only Fridays, and Saturdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sundays everyone tells the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice meets the three of them and calls them A, B, and C since she can’t tell them apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Alice heard: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A says, “I will lie tomorrow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B says, “I lied yesterday, and I will lie tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C says, “Today isn’t Tuesday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What day of the week did the conversation take place? Who are A, B, and C?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2023-Spring"></category></entry></feed>
